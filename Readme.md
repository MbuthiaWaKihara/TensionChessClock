# Purpose

<p>This project is a chess timer for android. It is meant to replace the chess clock, which can be a bit expensive and not portable.</p>
<p>The project focuses on letting chess players set up games quickly, by removing complex set up rules and interfaces and replacing them with a simple and straghtforward setup process</p>

# Author
<p>Kihara Evanson Mbuthia</p>

# Known Bugs
<p>Not really a bug but the icons used are low quality, they are not scaling well on all devices</p>
<p>Also the clock needs at least one other time control variant, probably most used after the increment is the bronstein delay</p>
<p>There is a plan to fix these and other undiscovered issues in later releases</p>
